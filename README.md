# ll

`ll` is a wrapper of the command line utility `ls`. It uses the `-lh` options by default and provides access to many icons.

## Installation

Add `ll` to your path or alias a command to the binary.

To be able to view the icons you need to set your terminal font to a font that support glyphs (most come from FontAwesome). Ideally you would use a [patched font from NerdFont](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

## Usage

`$ ll`
